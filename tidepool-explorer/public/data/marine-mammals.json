    "description": "Harbor seals are the most widely distributed species of pinniped and are found in coastal waters of the northern Atlantic and Pacific oceans, along with the North and Baltic seas.  They are brown, silvery white, tan, or gray, and can have spotted patterns. An adult harbor seal can be as large as 6' in length and as heavy as 370 pounds! The layer of blubber under the seal's skin helps to maintain body temperature. They like to stick to familiar resting spots or haul out sites, like Goff Island in Laguna Beach, which are generally rocky areas where they are protected from crashing waves, severe weather conditions or predation."

    "description": "Gray Whales can grow up to be over 50 feet long and they have gray bodies with small black eyes. Females are typically bigger than males. They are at high risk of getting stuck in fishing nets and when they get stuck they drag themselves along, resulting in fatigue which can lead to death. They are primarily bottom feeders scouring the ocean floor for food and are prayed on by killer whales."
