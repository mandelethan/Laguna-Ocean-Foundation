Each time the tide recedes, they return back to the tidepool in which it has taken up residence. Their coloration is varied, but it is often marbled in grey, brown and white. However, they can quickly camouflage themselves by changing colors to match their surrounding habitat so you may find them in either reddish or greenish coloration. Tidepool sculpins are predators, feeding on small invertebrates such as isopods, amphipods, gastropod molluscs, polychaete worms and barnacles, as well as insects that happen to fall into the water. Small amounts of algae also form part of the diet."
